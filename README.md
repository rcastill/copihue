# Copihue's TruckScript Game

## Description

[![Koding Hackathon](http://104.131.173.250/koding/koding/badge.png "Koding Hackathon")](https://koding.com/Hackathon)

This is a game to show and teach the idea of algorithms to beginners, but happens to get very difficult really fast.

In addition the player will learn multi thread through red lights, object-orientation and recursive instantiation.

The motivation behind was to give the player a really good game that he/she can enjoy and learn algorithms.
